      <p>In an alliance of six CSU campuses, we have worked to incorporate <em>socially responsible computing</em> (SRC) into our early CS courses in a sustained effort to improve the experience of students who are historically under-represented in computing majors.
Our explicit goal has been to increase retention rates of students identifying as Hispanic/Latino—currently, these students tend to leave the CS major at our institutions at far higher rates than other students.</p>

<p>This multi-year project was <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2216687&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">funded by the National Science Foundation in 2022</a>.
In this post, I summarize the work done by our team over the last two-and-a-half years.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Across our alliance of six campuses, we incorporated SRC in our intro CS courses. For example, at Cal Poly SLO, this took the form of a new data-centric introductory CS course focused on using computation to examine social trends and phenomena relevant to the students. The course is described in the paper <em><a href="/publications#sigcse2024cs0-course">Community-Action Computing: A Data-centric CS0 course</a></em> (SIGCSE 2024 Curricular Initiatives).</li>
  <li>We also participated in a faculty learning community that met for monthly workshops led by social scientists (Jane Lehr from Cal Poly SLO and Sarah Hug from Colorado Evaluation and Research Consulting). Some lessons learned from these workshops were published in <em><a href="/publications#sigcse2025src">Reflecting on Practices to Integrate Socially Responsible Computing in Introductory Computer Science Courses</a></em> (SIGCSE 2025 Experience Reports).</li>
  <li><strong>Finally (the focus of this post) we found that our curricular additions had positive impacts on students’ sense of belonging in computing and their perceived learning and agency in early CS courses.</strong> These results were published in <em><a href="/publications#toce2025src">The Benefits of Socially Responsible Computing in Early Computing Courses: A Multi-Institutional Study at Primarily Undergraduate Hispanic-Serving Institutions</a></em> (TOCE).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our team of authors is large and awesome, including folks from Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Los Angeles, San Francisco State University, CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU Fullerton, and the educational research non-profit <a href="wested.org">WestEd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>

<p><strong>What’s SRC?</strong> We sought to develop curricular materials (assignments, discussions) that demonstrated to students that they could use computing to benefit their communities and society, and to encourage students to think critically about the impacts of computing on society. This idea has <a href="https://responsible.cs.brown.edu/">been</a> <a href="https://ethicalcs.github.io/">around</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3702212.3702225">for</a> <a href="https://identity.cs.duke.edu/fellows.html">a while</a>.</p>

<p>We were also driven by the knowledge that <a href="https://paul-bruno.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lewis_2019_CommunalGoals.pdf">some students, more than others, are strongly drawn to disciplines that <em>they believe</em> would help benefit society</a>.
Clear signalling in early CS courses of computing’s impact on and relevance to society, and demonstration to students that even their nascent computing skills can be applied toward the social good should, in theory, improve their motivation and sense of belonging in computing.</p>

<p>Here’s one example of what we mean.
At Cal Poly SLO, we developed a new <a href="/publications#sigcse2024cs0-course">data-centric introductory programming course</a> in which students used <a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a> to analyze and visualize datasets about socially relevant phenomena.
Datasets were often chosen by the students themselves, and projects involved written and oral reflective components in addition to programs.
Students variously studied disparities in access to CS education in the state of California using data provided by the non-profit organization <a href="https://csforca.org">CSforCA</a>, data about the victims of fatal police shootings <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">compiled by the Washington Post</a>, and data about people’s access to fresh food compiled by the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/">US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service</a>.<sup id="fnref:corgis" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:corgis" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
In all cases, students were given freedom to choose their topics, ask their own questions, and present their findings to the rest of the class.</p>

<h2 id="did-it-work">Did it work?</h2>

<p>Over two academic years—2022-2023 and 2023–2024—we collected survey data from students at all six campuses to measure their sense of belonging in CS.
Belonging measured using the 26-item survey developed by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3432425">Moudgalya et al.</a>, containing statements about belonging scored from <em>Strongly disagree</em> (–3) to <em>Strongly agree</em> (3).
The Fall 2022 term was our “Baseline” group.
Surveyed classes were taught with no added SRC curricular materials.</p>

<p>Spring 2023, Fall 2023, and Spring 2024 were our “Intervention” groups (“Post” in the figure below).
All surveyed courses had significant SRC materials added, ranging from individual assignments with discussions and reflective components (as in the case of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630853">CSU Fullerton</a>) to entirely new courses (as in the case of <a href="/publications#sigcse2024cs0-course">Cal Poly SLO</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630926">San Francisco State University</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Our intervention had significant positive impacts on students’ sense of belonging at some campuses, but not others.</strong>
The split appeared to be between campuses that had “competitive enrolment policies” for their CS majors, and those that did not.
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328778.3366805">Nguyen and Lewis</a> describe competitive enrolment policies as those in which students at a University need to meet minimum GPA thresholds to declare a CS major and take the introductory courses, or where students are directly admitted to the CS major.</p>

<p>In our study, the two Cal Polys have competitive enrolment policies, due in large part to enrolment pressures: students are either admitted directly into the CS major or must satisfy fairly intensive requirements in order to transfer into the CS major.
Conversely, the other participating campuses—SFSU, Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, and CSU LA—have no such additional requirements for majoring in CS.
These campuses also have relatively higher proportions of students identifying as Hispanic/Latino.</p>

<p>In general, we saw that the campuses <em>without</em> competitive enrolment policies were more likely to report significant positive impacts from SRC curricular additions. The pattern is visible in the figure below.</p>

<p>(CSU Fullerton does not appear in this figure because no classes at Fullerton were surveyed in both the Baseline and Intervention terms. Fullerton features in other analyses in <a href="/publications#toce2025src">the paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>

<p>While there were <a href="/publications#toce2025src">other overall benefits</a> of our SRC curricular additions, in terms of sense of belonging our intervention appeared to impact students at some campuses far more than others.
Five of the six participating campuses in our alliance were designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions at the time the research was carried out (all except Cal Poly SLO).
We saw markedly different effects belonging between campuses that differed in important ways (like competitive enrolment, yes, but also other aspects like overall acceptance rates, representation and attrition of historically underrepresented students in CS, and percentage of students on federal Pell grants, a proxy for the overall socio-economic status of our student bodies).</p>

<p>We also found that Hispanic/Latino students at the campuses to without competitive enrolment policies were more likely than other students to report that work and family obligations interfered with their learning during the term.
No such effect was observed at the two participating Cal Polys.
These results underscore the importance of attending to institutional contextual differences when evaluating research results or considering (or disregarding) the adoption of curricular initiatives.</p>
