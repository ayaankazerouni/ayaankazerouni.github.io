          <p><em>I signed up for a short machine shop training, and was reminded what it’s like to do something for the first time and struggle with it. In related news, I am teaching intro programming again in the Fall.</em></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago some colleagues and I signed up for the Cal Poly College of Engineering <a href="https://ceng.calpoly.edu/connection/2019/09/red-tag-training-2/">Red Tag Tour</a> and earned our “red tags”.
These are passes that allow us to use the wood and sheet metal shop on the Cal Poly campus.
It was a 3-hour session that started with a whirlwind introduction to the machine shop in the Aero Hangar on campus, following which we worked through a scaffolded sequence of steps to make our own bookends.
Here’s mine:</p>

  </a>

  <figcaption>Not my best handiwork, but my only handiwork.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was a blast! I think it’s super cool that this is offered on our campus, and that they had a day where faculty could attend.
And I’m super grateful to the two student volunteers who were extremely patient with us.
What I do with my cool new red tag pass remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Anyway, we used a number of tools to make our bookends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A compound slide to cut a piece of acrylic</li>
  <li>A few different drill presses</li>
  <li>A miter saw to cut a length of wood</li>
  <li>A step shear to cut a sheet of metal (by far the most fun tool to use)</li>
  <li>A rotex punch to punch holes in the metal</li>
  <li>A corner shear to cut a 90° corner off the metal</li>
  <li>A finger brake to bend the sheet metal</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a nicely-designed activity meant to introduce us to the types of tools that are available in a typical machine shop and what they do.</p>

<p>I had never set foot in a machine shop before, so this was all new to me. And boy was I bad at it.</p>

<p>By that I mean there were many steps with which I struggled in many little ways; ways that I didn’t expect while watching the student volunteer demonstrate the steps beforehand.
For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While cutting the acrylic piece, I stopped pushing the acrylic through the saw when I felt the resistance reduce. But I had only cut through 3/4 of the acrylic, and didn’t immediately see this from my line of sight. This was easy to fix, but resulted in a cut that was not super smooth.</li>
  <li>While countersinking the holes I drilled in my acrylic piece, I first drilled too little, and then over-corrected and ended up with comically large rims (far bigger than the heads of the screws that eventually went in).</li>
  <li>While punching holes in the sheet metal, I didn’t do so in a smooth motion and ended up with holes that were jagged on the other side. Thanks to the student volunteer who hammered away at them to flatten them out!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been a while since I did something <em>totally, completely</em> new to me.
It felt good to be that far from familiar territory!
First, I promptly forgot a fair bit about all the tools to which I was introduced.
Then, after watching the student volunteer demonstrate the steps to build the bookend, I thought “okay, looks fine, I can do that”.
Finally, I proceeded to struggle in a bunch of little ways that neither they nor I expected.</p>

<p><strong>The experience has made me a bit more empathetic toward students in my introductory programming courses.</strong>
For example, the students in my CS 0 class have often never programmed before I see them, and they are doing something <em>totally, completely</em> new to them.</p>

<p>A really reductive description of my intro course might be that I introduce students to a bunch of “tools” (<del>drill presses, step shear, miter saw</del> control flow, functions, test cases) and give them scaffolded practice tasks (<del>making a bookend</del> making data visualisations).
They then proceed to work on their bookends, and while doing so struggle in little ways that neither they nor I expected.</p>

<p>It’s hard to do things for the first time!</p>

<p>It’s also worth remembering that I don’t have any personal investment in being good at wood- or metal-working, so I was comfortable asking for help when I needed it, and was okay with taking a bit more time to make my bookend if I needed to.</p>

<p><strong>This is usually not so for first-year CS students.</strong>
At Cal Poly we have a “competitive enrolment policy”, i.e., students are admitted directly into the CS major, or need to jump through some GPA hoops to transfer into the CS major.
This can be a bad thing,<sup id="fnref:competitive-enrolment-policy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:competitive-enrolment-policy" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in part because it results in students already having a bunch of perceived self-worth wrapped up in being good at computer science, which can get in the way of their learning.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m grateful to the Red Tag training for (1) existing, and (2) reminding me what it’s like to be a student doing something for the first time.
I will try to remember the feeling during Q&amp;A sessions and office hours.</p>
