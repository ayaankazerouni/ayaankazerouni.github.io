<p>Welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> CSC 513 Computing Education: Research and Practice</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> An overview of the current landscape of computing education research and practice, covering key findings about how people learn computing, diversity and equity in CS, and a discussion of how and why <em>computing</em> goes beyond <em>computer science.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Graduate standing or consent of instructor.</p>

<h3 id="course-info">Course info</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ayaan M. Kazerouni <a href="mailto:ayaank@calpoly.edu">ayaank@calpoly.edu</a></li>
  <li><strong>Office hours</strong>: <strong>_______</strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="#course-schedule">Course Schedule</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Meetings:</strong> MW 2:10pm—4pm</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom link: ______</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Report format:</strong> All written submissions will be PDFs written using the standard ACM conference paper format. Here’s a <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx">sample Word doc</a>. If you prefer to use LaTeX, get the required files <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip">here</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Reports will be written professionally, as if for an academic publication. First-person pronouns (“I”, “we”) are okay—what’s important is be to <em>clear</em>, <em>concise, and precise</em>.</li>
      <li>Don’t use contractions like I have done throughout this syllabus :-)</li>
      <li>Avoid making claims without (1) citing supporting evidence, or (2) making it clear that you <em>believe</em> something <em>might</em> be true.</li>
      <li>When you do make a claim supported by evidence, be sure to include <em>context</em>. For example, student performance in a CS course can mean very different things depending on the level of the students, the environment (was it an accelerated intro to CS for AP CS takers?), the pedagogy and programming language used, etc.</li>
      <li>All references (papers, books, blog posts, YouTube videos, software) should be cited in a bibliography. The sample Word doc contains toy references, and LaTeX users should use BibTeX.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> A basic understanding of computing has been called a “21st Century Literacy”, allowing a person to better engage with and reason about the digital environments in which much of our personal and professional lives take place. As computer scientists, not only are we are uniquely situated to thrive in this digital era, we are also in a good position to help democratise this potential. To do that, there is a need for computing educators and computing education researchers to push forward the science of computing education at all levels. This course aims to present students with the landscape of What We Know about how people learn computing, to train them to critically examine research in the area, and to propose new work that expands our knowledge of the subject.</p>

<h4 id="zoom-policies">Zoom Policies</h4>

<p><strong>Cameras</strong></p>

<p>I request that you keep your cameras turned on during class periods. I don’t ask this lightly—I recognise that not everyone has a place where they’re able to or comfortable with a webcam pointing into the place they live or work. But this is a discussion based course, and it will be driven mostly by <em>you</em>. I’ll participate too, but there’s only one of me and ~30 of you—a sea of Zoom avatars is unlikely to encourage lively discussion.</p>

<p>That said, this is a request, not a requirement. If you have some reason you absolutely cannot turn on your camera, I understand.</p>

<p><strong>Microphones</strong></p>

<p>Just like we’re all used to by now, let’s keep our microphones muted unless we’re saying something.</p>

<p><strong>Profile name</strong></p>

<p><em>Please use your real name in Zoom</em>, and sign in using your Cal Poly email.</p>

<p><strong>Chat</strong></p>

<p>You may use the Zoom chat to post points of discussion while others are speaking. This helps to keep the discussion moving and is minimally obtrusive.</p>

<h3 id="learning-goals">Learning goals</h3>

<p>After this course, you will be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Discuss the current landscape of computing education research: what we know, what we don’t know, and grand challenges</li>
  <li>Interpret research findings within the context of learning theories in engineering education and computing education</li>
  <li>Discuss evidence-based teaching practices like peer instruction, subgoal-labelling, and pair programming</li>
  <li>Understand causes, effects, and considerations for underrepresented and overrepresented demographics in computing education</li>
  <li>Come up with your own answer to the question: <em>Should everyone learn computing? Why or why not?</em></li>
  <li>Identify an open question in computing education research; design and propose a study to answer the question</li>
</ol>

<p>In pursuit of the goals above, this course will involve a fair amount of:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Reading</strong> papers, book chapters, and articles about various related topics</li>
  <li><strong>Critical discussion</strong> of the assigned readings, often guided by prompts or activities in class</li>
  <li><strong>Writing</strong> summaries and critiques of the assigned readings, and a research study proposal</li>
  <li><strong>Presenting</strong> your chosen research questions: once as a “lightning talk” introducing the question and soliciting feedback, and once as a longer talk describing your designed research study</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="grading-and-assessments">Grading and assessments</h3>

<p>Grades will be distributed across the following items.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research study proposal (40%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>5% — Lightning talk (3–5 minutes; due <strong>Feb 15</strong>)</li>
      <li>10% — Research question white paper (1–2 pages; due <strong>Feb 22</strong>)</li>
      <li>15% — Research proposal write-up (6–10 pages; due in <strong>the last week</strong>)</li>
      <li>10% — Research proposal presentation (7–10 minutes; due in <strong>the last week)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reading reflections (30%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Short reflections on our readings, typically once a week, sometimes twice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Paper sleuthing (25%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>2 due by <strong>Feb 12</strong>; 2 due by <strong>the last week</strong></li>
      <li>Over the course of the quarter, read 4 papers from the perspective of a given <em>role</em> (see below for details). Submit a write-up based on what you find (1–2 pages)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Participation (5%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a discussion-based class, and so participation is an especially important component. This includes participation in class and on the discussion boards.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Details about these assessments are below.</p>

<h4 id="reading-reflections">Reading reflections</h4>

<p>Each week will involve reading a few papers (roughly two per class period). To “seed” the discussion, these will often be accompanied by reflection prompts. You can find these under “Reading reflections” on the assignments page. Please plan to spend some time on these reflections—some weeks may take more time than others because the prompts involve tasks in addition to a short written response.</p>

<p>But most importantly, read the papers critically, connect them with what we’ve learned from this class and from your own experience (after all, you’ve been CS students for years), and come to class ready to participate in the discussion!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frequency: about 1 per week, but some weeks have 2</li>
  <li>Responses need not be very long, but they should be substantive. You can say a lot in 250–300 words.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="reflection-prompts">[List of Winter 2021 reflection prompts]</a></p>

<h4 id="paper-sleuthing">Paper sleuthing</h4>

<p>Read and analyse a paper with a specific <em>role</em> in mind. Write up your analysis in 1–2 pages. There are <strong>four</strong> possible roles (below); you should make <strong>1 submission per role,</strong> and each submission should cover a <strong>different paper or topic</strong>. The roles are described below and each has some specific instructions.</p>

<p>You may choose any papers from our reading list for these submissions (or email me for approval if it’s a paper that’s not on our list). There’s no ordering requirement on roles or papers chosen.</p>

<p><strong><a href="paper-sleuthing">Detailed guidelines</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Roles</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The archaeologist</strong> determines where the paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work. Find and report on at least one older paper cited by the current paper and at least one newer paper citing the current paper. Draw a clear research connection between the past paper, the current paper, and the subsequent paper.</li>
  <li><strong>The master’s student</strong> will propose an imaginary follow-on project based on the current paper.<sup id="fnref:ms-student" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ms-student" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The follow-on project is not just related to the current paper, but is made possible or plausible <em>because</em> of the current paper. Your submission should introduce and motivate the project, and describe and how it relates to the current paper.</li>
  <li><strong>The faculty member</strong> is assessing the plausibility of applying the current paper’s findings or methods in our department’s CS courses. This should be written with the rest of the faculty (or the department chair or college Dean) as the imagined audience. This submission is trying to answer the questions: <em>Can and should we do this in our courses? Which course(s)? What would it take to do it? If you are not familiar with Cal Poly’s undergraduate CS courses, you can speak in broad terms like “CS 1”, “core courses”, or “data structures”.</em></li>
  <li><strong>The private investigator</strong> would like to find background information about one of the paper authors—ideally, the first author (typically the student who wrote the paper) or the last author (the primary faculty advisor). Where have they worked? What did they study? What previous projects of there’s might have led to working on this one?</li>
</ul>

<p>At the top of each submission, please clearly include your name and the role under which you’re writing. The submission should include a reference for the paper you’re writing about. I encourage you to be strategic about the papers and roles you choose—for example, the <strong>master’s student</strong> role should almost certainly be reserved for a paper or topic closely related to your research proposal.</p>

<p>I’ve kept the due dates for these somewhat fluid to give you some agency. But, to avoid these piling up at the end of the quarter, these will have the following “milestone” deadlines:<sup id="fnref:deadlines" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deadlines" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 are due by <strong>February 12 at noon</strong></li>
  <li>2 are due by <strong>March 10 at noon</strong> (last day of the quarter)</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn’t mean you should wait to submit the first two them on February 12! In fact, your sleuthing submission could form the kernel of your research white-paper (see below), which in turn forms the kernel of your final report.</p>

<h4 id="research-study-proposal">Research study proposal</h4>

<p>Identify a novel research question and design a research study to answer that question. The final proposal should contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe why the question is answerable and ought to be answered.</li>
  <li>Concretely describe an experiment to help answer the question. This means actually designing and/or prototyping the research instruments or tools you might need. Designing a survey? Include the survey questions in your submission. Designing educational technology? Include initial prototypes, lo-fi or hi-fi if time permits.</li>
  <li>Discuss implications of the study. How would our understanding or our teaching methods change based on the results of the study?</li>
</ul>

<p>Research studies can take the following forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A testable hypothesis and an experiment to test it: e.g., <em>playing death metal in the hallways improves learning outcomes in CS courses.</em> The hypothesis should be well grounded—is there a theory of cognition/motivation that suggests that death metal helps learning? Or perhaps there is evidence that rock ‘n roll helps learning, and we would like to see if this transfers to death metal.</li>
  <li>An experiment that tests a theory: e.g., <em>Spatial encoding strategy (SpES) theory</em> from Lauren Margulieux attempts to explain the relationship between spatial reasoning skills and STEM achievement; you could design an experiment to help support or refute SpES</li>
  <li>A one- to two-week module to teach a topic of your choosing; your submission would include a description of the design process as well as a proposed experiment to evaluate the module</li>
  <li>An educational tool or modification to an existing tool, e.g., a pedagogic IDE, a plugin to make Eclipse or IntelliJ easier on novices, a dashboard for learning analytics, visualisations for CS concepts, etc.</li>
  <li>A reasoned critique of a CS education tool, module, or pedagogy based on relevant theory, and suggestions for improvements</li>
  <li>A systematic literature review, e.g., <em>A systematic review of assessments of software tests</em>—note that this is not simply a summarisation of existing research, but rather a synthesis of existing research to provide new insights and potential future research</li>
  <li>A valid and reliable instrument to measure learning, self-efficacy, motivation, belonging, or other aspects of interest in computing education</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deciding on your project</strong>. You can choose your own research topic, area, and methodology within computing education. There are a couple of “milestone” submissions (see below) which you can use to solicit feedback and approval for your project topic; this is mostly to discuss scope rather than the actual topic. But you need not wait till submissions to get feedback; feel free to get in touch with me over email or office hours to discuss projects.</p>

<p>There are several deliverables to this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 1–2 page white paper about your research question—this should contain the question itself, the motivation, and theoretical basis. <strong>Due February 24 at noon.</strong></li>
  <li>A 3–5 minute lightning talk, delivered on Zoom, about the question and its importance. <strong>Due February 15, in class.</strong></li>
  <li>A 6–10 page proposal describing the question and the research study designed to answer it. <strong>Due March 8 at noon.</strong></li>
  <li>A 7–10 minute presentation, delivered on Zoom, describing your research study. <strong>Due March 8 in class.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can communicate with me and your classmates using the Slack channel I have set up for this course.</li>
  <li>Note that there are assigned reading reflection discussion items, but you should feel free to raise other interesting papers or topics of discussion in Slack.</li>
  <li>You are also encouraged to seek feedback about project ideas in Slack—that way you can get feedback from me + 30 other smart and motivated people!</li>
</ul>

      <p>This ended up overlapping significantly with the final proposal; having both was probably not useful. <a href="#fnref:ms-student" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:deadlines" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This ended up backfiring—I received about 60 submissions on the first deadline, and 90 submissions on the second deadline. Do not recommend. <a href="#fnref:deadlines" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>All told, this may have been too much writing, so this will change. <a href="#fnref:writing" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
