      <h1>Lightning talks</h1>
      <p>Give a 5-minute presentation about your thesis project. Suppose you’re walking across campus and your friend with a CS background asks “So what are you doing for your thesis project?”. You have a few minutes to tell your friend about your work, as you’re walking to your next class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your presentation should focus on identifying your topic and describing what is interesting about it. Why is it important that this work be done? I.e., what are potential implications of your results?</li>
  <li>You can discuss some historical background and related work, but you don’t have time to get into these in detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you adhere to the 5-minute time limit.</p>

<p>You don’t have to prepare slides, but you can if you think it will help you communicate your project more clearly. Remember that you will be graded on your clarity, so consider carefully if slides can help.</p>
