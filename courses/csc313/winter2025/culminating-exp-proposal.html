      <h1>CSC 313 Culminating experience proposal</h1>
      <p>The culminating experience for this class is one of your own choosing given the approval of the course instructor.  In general, the spirit of this assignment is for you to dig deeper into computing education, either by having an additional teaching experience (preferred), or by proposing and possibly conducting a novel research project. This is worth 15% of your total grade in the class. I will consider proposals for new curricula, but I don’t expect many of these to be approved.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas for culminating experience project include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>development and execution of an additional teaching experience, followed by a reflection (<strong>preferred</strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>If you are doing this, work with me early in the quarter so we can work with the library to reserve space and send out advertising</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a research paper about a related topic (dig deeper into any of the data we have explored this quarter)</li>
  <li>a survey paper (read 5-6 papers about a topic and summarise and synthesise them)</li>
  <li>a well developed research proposal (methodology, metrics, related works, etc.) or perhaps a complete project if the methodology can be completed via survey, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may work individually or in small groups (3-4), with the end product scaling up depending on the number of students involved. <strong>If you wish to work in a group, you will form the groups yourselves and include all members’ names on your proposal submission.</strong></p>

<p>To help scope this project, we will start with a project proposal.  Submit at least a 1 paragraph proposal (for each/any) idea you’d like to pitch as your final project.</p>

<p>While looking for ideas, feel free to look at the papers we have read this quarter.</p>

<p>Also take a look at these resources:</p>

</ul>

<p>Papers from various conferences related to CS Education Research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/sigcse/proceedings">Special Interest Group on CS Education (SIGCSE) Technical Symposium</a> (commonly just called the “SIGCSE” conference)
    <ul>
      <li>Here you’ll find a little bit of everything! Tends to be North America-centric.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/icer/proceedings">International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Mostly quantitative work, though that is changing recently. Generally high-quality papers with strong theoretical foundations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/iticse/proceedings">The conference on Innovation and Technology in CS Education (ITiCSE)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort of like a smaller, European SIGCSE.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/koli-calling/proceedings">Koli Calling conference</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort of a smaller ICER, in my opinion more accepting of qualitative work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once groups are finalised, I will create the groups in Canvas so that only one group member needs to do the submission.</p>
