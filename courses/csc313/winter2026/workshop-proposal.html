      <h1>CSC 313 Workshop proposal</h1>
      <p>The culminating experience for this class is one of your own choosing given the approval of the course instructor.
The spirit of this assignment is for you to design and teach a computing workshop to an audience of community members in San Luis Obispo (e.g., individuals at the public library, fellow Cal Poly students, or local school students).</p>

<p>By this time, you have been organised into groups and been assigned a workshop host and intended audience.</p>

<p>Submit an initial proposal for your teaching workshop.</p>

<p>This assignment’s goal is get all of your wheels turning as your brainstorm about your workshop.
What you write here will be sent to the folks who are hosting the workshops, so make sure it is informative and concise.
It may also serve as the blurb that gets included in advertising materials.</p>

<p>This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The topic.</li>
  <li>The (expected) audience. Describe your audience in terms of “personas”, i.e., examples of imagined individuals who will attend and benefit from your workshop. If you would like to hear more about your workshop host and their audience, talk to me! Please read <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas">Greg Wilson’s description of Learner Personas</a> before you write this section.</li>
  <li>Your initial plans or ideas for the workshop. These are not binding, but I want you to start brainstorming with this proposal.</li>
</ul>
