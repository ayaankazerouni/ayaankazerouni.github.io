      <h1>CSC 313 Mind mapping</h1>
      <p>This activity is meant to help you summarise and connect everything you’ve learned this quarter.
We’ll do this through the use of <strong>concept mapping</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Since this class doesn’t have a final exam, and your final project focuses specifically on <em>designing and teaching a workshop</em>, this activity is a chance to step back and see the bigger picture as a connected whole rather than a series of weekly topics.</p>

<p>Our goal is to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>topics that you found particularly interesting or important,</li>
  <li>connections between topics that may not have been immediately obvious, e.g., between use of generative AI and the pedagogical programming languages we studied last week</li>
  <li>topics that you wish we had studied or studied in more depth,</li>
  <li>topics that you think will influence you in the future; even if you don’t become a teacher, you will likely play some kind of mentoring role no matter what your professional role ends up being</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="core-task">Core task</h2>

<p>With the people at your table, create a concept map about the class topics we have covered this quarter.
Some resources to help you along are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The course schedule and Canvas</li>
  <li>Your own experiences shadowing tutors, teaching, and designing instructional materials this quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use any of the following tools to create the map:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pencil and paper</li>
  <li>post-it notes and whiteboard markers (let me know and I will bring you post-it notes from the mailroom)</li>
  <li>https://www.mindmup.com/ </li>
  <li>https://draw.io</li>
  <li>https://www.mindmaps.app/</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/flowchart.html">mermaid.js</a> has a pretty simple syntax, and renders natively in markdown files opened in VSCode</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basic-requirementssuggestions">Basic requirements/suggestions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I recommend starting with a central node called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computing education</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teaching computing</code> and start branching outward from there.</li>
  <li>Use the course schedule as a reference if needed.</li>
  <li>Don’t repeat node labels.</li>
  <li>Aim to have at least 12 nodes, and try to include topics from at least 5 weeks. But feel free to expand beyond that as well!</li>
  <li>Annotate edges if you’d like to give context to a connection between nodes.</li>
  <li>If you’re including a topic that we <em>haven’t</em> talked about, or that you wish we had talked about more, indicate that in the node.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h2>

<p>Submit your map as an image. If you worked on pen and paper, take a picture and submit that. If you worked in an online tool, export the map as an image.</p>

<p>Please also add all group members’ names to the Canvas submission.</p>

<p>After you’ve created and submitted your concept map, be prepared to discuss it with the class.</p>
