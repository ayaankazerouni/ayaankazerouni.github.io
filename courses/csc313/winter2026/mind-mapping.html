      <h1>CSC 313 Mind mapping</h1>
      <p>This activity is meant to help you summarise and connect everything you’ve learned this quarter.
We’ll do this through the use of <strong>mind-mapping</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What’s a mind map?</strong> A Mind Map is a diagram for representing tasks, words, concepts, or items linked to and arranged around a central concept or subject using a non-linear graphical layout that allows the user to build an intuitive framework around a central concept.<sup id="fnref:defn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:defn" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>You can think of it like the concept maps we learned about earlier this quarter, except you are using to summarise what you know, and to discover connections that might not be immediately obvious to you.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of mind-mapping is to help you think about what you’ve learned by visually organising topics in a network of connected topics.
This is somewhat akin to what we’ve learned about how our minds organise knowledge.</p>

<p>The goal is to produce a visual representation of your own ideas related to Teaching Computing. I hope the process of producing this map helps you realise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>topics that you found particularly interesting or important,</li>
  <li>topics that you wish we had studied or studied more in-depth,</li>
  <li>topics that you think you will influence you in your future job; even if you don’t become a teacher, you will likely play some kind of mentoring role no matter what your professional role ends up being</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="core-task">Core task</h2>

<p>With the people at your table, create a mind map about the class topics we have covered this quarter.
Some resources to help you along are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The course schedule and Canvas</li>
  <li>Your own experiences shadowing tutors, teaching, and designing instructional materials this quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use any of the following online tools to create the map:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.mindmup.com/ </li>
  <li>https://draw.io</li>
  <li>https://www.mindmaps.app/</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, if you prefer to be more “analog”, you can collect a bunch of post-it notes and connect them on the whiteboard (maybe I can find post-it notes in the mailroom, let me know).</p>

<p><strong>Some basic requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The central node of your map should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computing education</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teaching computing</code> or something similar, since everything we’ve talked about has been related to computing education. You will create additional nodes or subtrees that are offshoots from this central node.</li>
  <li>Don’t repeat labels.</li>
  <li>Feel free to expand your map to as many levels or nodes as you see fit, and to annotate edges if appropriate.</li>
  <li>If you’re including a topic that we <em>haven’t</em> talked about, or that you wish we had talked about more, indicate that in the node.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h2>

<p>Submit your map as an image. If you worked on pen and paper, take a picture and submit that. If you worked in an online tool, export the map as an image.</p>

<p>Please also add all group members’ names to the Canvas submission.</p>

<p>After you’ve created and submitted your mind-map, be prepared to discuss it with the class.</p>
