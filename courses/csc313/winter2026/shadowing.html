      <h1>Shadowing tutors</h1>
      <p>As a part of learning about teaching computing, we will be working  with some of the amazing CSSE tutors. If you are not familiar with the tutoring centre, please see: <a href="https://csc.calpoly.edu/tutoring">https://csc.calpoly.edu/tutoring</a></p>

<p>Our goal for this quarter is that 313 students will participate with helping staff the tutoring centre alongside these experienced tutors later in the quarter. The first step in this process is to shadow with a current tutor. <strong>Sign up if you haven’t already.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ayaank_calpoly_edu/IQCAspM_lPPFQo0QvyUshchPAaxxoS3MYCG6bS8bMKz0j94?e=Mo2Old">Here is the sign-up sheet</a>. You’ll need to sign in with your Cal Poly email to access it.</p>

<p>Please sign up with your name and email for a slot to shadow a tutor this week. Signing up is a commitment that you’re expected to manage.</p>

<p>Your role in this assignment is to be an observer.  You are welcome to chat with the tutor outside of the actual tutoring session, but otherwise, please just quietly observe the session and make observations using the following form (in Canvas).</p>

<p><a href="https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/172956/quizzes/304651">Tutor session observation form</a></p>

<p><strong>A note on your mindset when filling it out</strong>: The form is meant to be a reflection exercise for you, <em>not an evaluation of the tutor you are observing</em>. Keep this in mind as you do the observation.</p>

<p>The last question is open-ended: please use it as an opportunity to note connections to what we’ve learned in class.</p>

<p>For example, did you see instances of the <em>parallelism, intentionality,</em> or <em>egocentrism</em> bugs? Did you note specific inaccuracies in students’ mental models about programming language behaviour? Did you see instances where <em>problem comprehension</em>, as opposed to <em>program comprehension</em> were a cause of difficulties?</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> The form appears as a survey in Canvas.
Although the due date is set to January 27 (the last day of shadowing before tutoring begins). you should complete your reflection immediately after your shadowing session, or as close to it as possible.</p>
