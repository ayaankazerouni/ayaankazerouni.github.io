    <p><strong>Programming:</strong> To think about teaching computing, we will begin with reflections on our own coding process. This course includes programming assignments that involve process documentation and reflections. This process will include code review and shared assessment of one’s process and code.</p>

    <p><strong>Reading</strong>: I will assign course readings to help you engage with the material. Please complete these readings before class. These may be quizzes (meant to be taken as you read) or discussion prompts. These are usually graded based on good faith effort. The goal is to ensure you come to class having given some thought to that day’s topic.</p>

    <p><strong>In-class discussions</strong>: We’ll have frequent small-group discussions during lecture and lab sessions. These will often be accompanied by Canvas submissions.</p>

    <p><strong>Tutoring/Teaching observations:</strong> You will practice shadow experienced CS tutors and conduct your own tutoring sessions in <del>the CSSE tutoring centre</del> lab sessions of introductory CS courses.</p>

    <p>Additionally, this quarter the CSSE department will be bringing in tenure-track faculty candidates as part of the interview/hiring process.
That means, several candidates will be visiting campus and, as part of their interview, will be giving teaching demonstrations.
<strong>It’s much better for them to “teach” students rather than other faculty.</strong></p>

    <p>Conversely, it will be helpful for you to see teaching demonstrations and submit your own evaluations (to me).
So, another component of your grade will be your evaluations of <em>at least</em> 2 teaching demonstrations during the quarter.<sup id="fnref:demos" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:demos" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

    <p>I will keep you all up to date as visit dates get decided; keep an eye out! I don’t know the exact dates yet, but they will be Mondays and Fridays at 1pm.
If you can’t make any of the visits, we will figure out some other teaching critique activity.</p>

    <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: See the attendance policy later in this Syllabus.</p>

    <p><strong>Teaching workshop</strong>: In consultation with the instructor, students will design and teach a computing workshop to interested students. I will provide a number of possible opportunities to which groups will be assigned based on student interests. <em>If you (or your club, etc.) have an organised teaching activity you’d like to set up, that can also count. Please talk to me ASAP if this is the case.</em></p>

    <p>You will work with real workshop hosts to offer this workshop. For example, instructors at Cal Poly, local school teachers, librarians at SLO Public Libraries, or club leaders at Cal Poly.
Part of your grade for this component rests on professional, timely, and consistent communication with these individiuals.</p>

    <p>Here are examples of things that might lead to point deductions in this regard:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lack of communication with your workshop host. For example, you should meet with your workshop host at least once (their schedule permitting), before your workshop to communicate your plan to them and receive feedback. This can happen during our scheduled lab times.</li>
      <li>Discourteous communication with your workshop host. Remember, they are doing us a favour by letting us get some teaching experience!</li>
      <li>I have individual chats with workshop hosts after your workshops. It’s not likely, but evidence of unprofessional conduct during the workshop will lead to point deductions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="callout note">I acknowledge that this course involves a number of scheduled time commitments outside of class time.
While the total workload may not significantly exceed that of, say, homeworks in other classes, I know that for those managing external obligations, setting aside time for tutoring and workshops can be challenging.
In these cases, please talk to me.
We can work something out.</p>

    <h2 id="course-communication">Course communication</h2>

    <p>All course communication will take place in Slack. <strong>See Canvas for a link to the workspace and an invite link.</strong></p>

    <p>Please bookmark this Slack workspace, and make sure to do at least one of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Download the Slack app to your computer or phone, or if you don’t like push notifications,</li>
      <li>Sign in to Slack and enable email notifications so that announcements come to your email (if you don’t like push notifications, you can set it to email you when there is activity that needs your attention, like announcements).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All communication for this course will take place in the Slack workspace.
Questions that are of general interest to the class should be sent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#all</code> channel.
If you’re not comfortable asking questions publicly, you can DM me, and I might post the question and answer to the public channel if I think it would be helpful.</p>

    <p>The Slack workspace also provides a convenient way for you to interact with your teammates, and for me to communicate with each team.</p>

    <h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance policy</h2>

    <p>What we discuss in lectures will be directly put into practice in your workshop and tutoring sessions. If you miss class, your teaching will be poorer as a result, and <strong>real students</strong> who come to learn from you will be negatively impacted.
Additionally, the course involves <strong>significant teamwork</strong>. Most lab sessions will be devoted to this teamwork. If you miss lab sessions, you would be letting your teammates down.</p>

    <p><strong>All this adds up to: I strongly recommend that you come to class!</strong></p>

    <p>Here’s the policy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I will take roll in most class sessions. 5% of your final course grade is based on attendance.</li>
      <li>Additionally, there will often be in-class discussions with deliverables that cannot be completed outside of class.</li>
      <li>After workshop teams have been formed and your team begins preparing for the workshop (this will happen around week 3), <em>attendance in lab is mandatory for the rest of the quarter</em>. Lab sessions are the primary time when your team can work together on your workshop, and is also when I can get get visibility into the team’s progress and provide feedback.
        <ul>
          <li>At minimum, if you cannot come to lab, let me and your teammates know.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In case of emergencies, don’t worry about attendance, and talk to me when you are able to do so.</p>

    <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

    <p>I know that everyone is unique, and I may have unintentionally overlooked something that limits access to some materials or activities. Please let me know if you cannot access any content. If you need additional accommodations to complete the required course work, please contact me as soon as possible! You should also contact the <a href="https://drc.calpoly.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="classroom-climate">Classroom climate</h2>

    <p>All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment.
I expect us to strive to build a community in which:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We are not code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.</li>
      <li>After our own work is complete, we support one another’s learning by sharing our expertise generously if invited to do so.</li>
      <li>We consistently make the effort to actively recognise and validate multiple types of contributions to a positive classroom environment.</li>
      <li>We strive to contribute meaningfully to group work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="course-schedule">Course schedule</h2>

    <p>This is a tentative course schedule meant to give a bird’s eye view of the course.
If things change (and they will!), I will update this table.</p>

    <p>(For instance, it’s very likely readings for later weeks will change based on class discussions.)</p>

    <p>Assignments will also appear in Canvas with deadlines and submission endpoints.
If deadlines here conflict with deadlines in Canvas, <strong><em>deadlines in Canvas take precedence</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>In addition to the assignments shown below, there will be occasional pre-class readings and frequent in-class activities that will appear in Canvas.</p>
