      <h1>CSC 313 Culminating experience presentation</h1>
      <p>Each culminating experience “group” (including those doing their projects individually) will give a 7–10 minute presentation outlining their project (see below for details). The goal for this presentation is primarily to get some intermediate feedback on your project, from both  myself and your classmates. Since we are somewhat time bound by external factors—i.e., the scheduled workshops or teaching activities—we’ll do these on Thursdays of weeks 5, 6, and 7.</p>

<p>Each team will present what they have prepared the week before their workshop.
Presentations will take place during the first part of the day’s lab session.
Attendance for these lab sessions is mandatory unless arranged with me beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="contents-of-the-presentation">Contents of the presentation</h2>

<p>Here are items that your presentations should include (not necessarily in the order given).</p>

<p>Your presentation should cover the following content:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intended audience.</strong> In terms of experience with computing and/or any other dimensions that are relevant)</li>
  <li><strong>Learning objectives.</strong> These should be phrased in terms of <em>measurable items.</em> For example, “Understand Python syntax” is not a good learning objective, because it’s not clear how to measure whether someone understands Python syntax. Instead, you can say “given a snippet of Python code and an input, a student should be able to predict what its output will be”.</li>
  <li><strong>Contents of your workshop.</strong> This is the bulk of your presentation. Presumably, by the week preceding your workshop, you should have a really good idea of what your workshop will look like. Communicate this to us. You don’t need to give us a minute-by-minute breakdown, but walk us through the exercises/activities and how they relate to your stated learning objectives.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be your primary opportunity to get some feedback about your planned workshop before you run it.
You will receive feedback from me and your classmates.
Please give due consideration to all feedback items and make updates as feasible and appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h2>

<p>There is no online submission for this. You’ll be graded primarily based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completeness (i.e., addresses all the requested items to a satisfactory degree)</li>
  <li>Preparedness</li>
</ul>
