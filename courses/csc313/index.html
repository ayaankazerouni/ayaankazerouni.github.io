<h4 id="details">Details</h4>

<p><strong>Programming:</strong> To think about teaching computing, we will begin with reflections on our own coding process. This course includes programming assignments that involve process documentation and reflections. This process will include code review and shared assessment of one’s process and code.</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong> We will engage with seminal and emerging computing education research. In most cases this will mean reading research papers.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching/tutoring:</strong> We will practice teaching computing via both shadowing experienced CS tutors and tutoring in the online tutoring for 101, 202 and 203 students. You’ll also hold a brief session in our introductory class lab sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Culminating experience:</strong> In consultation with the instructor, students will select a final culminating experience. Options include a fully developed research methodology, a written survey of literature associated with a specific topic in CS education, a portfolio of educational materials gathered throughout the course and possibly live or virtual outreach events focused on CS education. I will be posting opportunities for this last type of project throughout the quarter.</p>

<h3 id="course-communication">Course communication</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slack channel</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Invite link (expires _____)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All communication for this course will take place in the Slack channel linked above. Questions that are of general interest to the class should be sent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#questions</code> channel. If you’re not comfortable asking questions publicly, you can DM me, and I might post the question and answer to the public channel if I think it would be helpful.</p>

<p>Other benefits of using Slack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can communicate with your classmates in Slack as well</li>
  <li>Although there are assigned readings which will sometimes have Canvas Discussions associated with them, you should feel free to raise points of discussion yourself in Slack</li>
  <li>You’re encouraged to seek feedback about projects in the #general channel—that way you can get feedback from me as well as 34 other smart and motivated people!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance policy</h3>

<p>There is no explicit attendance policy for this class. However,</p>

<ul>
  <li>There will occasionally be graded activities in class that you must be present to complete.</li>
  <li>This class is <em>heavily</em> driven by discussions of the day’s activity or reading. If you’re not attending class, you’d just be passively following a reading list.</li>
  <li>A non-trivial component of your final grade is based on <em>participation—</em>participation in discussions, participation in small group activities, etc. You cannot participate if you’re not in class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All this adds up to: I strongly recommend that you come to class!</strong></p>

<p>I do know that you all have a lot going on, so if you need to miss class on a given day, let me know ahead of time and I can let you make up any activity you might have missed.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

<p>I know that everyone is unique, and I may have unintentionally overlooked something that limits access to some materials or activities. Please let me know if you cannot access any content. If you need additional accommodations to complete the  required course work, please contact me as soon as possible! You should also contact the <a href="https://drc.calpoly.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>.</p>

<p>SensusAccess is a self-service,  alternate media solution made available by Kennedy Library to  automatically convert files into a range of alternative media including  audiobooks (MP3 and DAISY), e-books (EPUB, EPUB3, and Mobi) and digital Braille. The service can also be used to convert inaccessible files such as image-only PDF files, JPG pictures, and Microsoft PowerPoint  presentations into more accessible and less tricky formats. This service is available at no charge.</p>

<h3 id="classroom-climate">Classroom climate</h3>

<p>All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment.
I expect us to strive to build a community in which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are not code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.</li>
  <li>After our own work is complete, we support one another’s learning by sharing our expertise generously if invited to do so.</li>
  <li>We consistently make the effort to actively recognise and validate multiple types of contributions to a positive classroom environment.</li>
  <li>We strive to contribute meaningfully to group work.</li>
</ul>
