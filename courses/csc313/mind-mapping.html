      <h1>CSC 313 Mind mapping</h1>
      <p>In this activity we’re going to summarise and put into context the things we’ve learned this quarter.
We’ll do this through the use of <strong>mind-mapping</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What’s a mind map?</strong> A Mind Map is a diagram for representing tasks, words, concepts, or items linked to and arranged around a central concept or subject using a non-linear graphical layout that allows the user to build an intuitive framework around a central concept.<sup id="fnref:defn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:defn" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>Building on what we know about how our brains organise knowledge, the goal of mind-mapping is to help along the process of thinking about what you’ve learned, by visually organising topics in a network of connected topics.</p>

<p>The goal is to produce a visual representation of your own ideas related to Teaching Computing. I hope the process of producing this map helps you realise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>topics that you found particularly interesting or important this quarter</li>
  <li>topics that you wish we had studied or studied more in-depth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="core-task">Core task</h2>

<p>With the people at your table, create a mind map about the class topics we have covered this quarter.
Some resources to help you along are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The course schedule and Canvas</li>
  <li>Your own experiences shadowing tutors, teaching, and designing instructional materials this quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the map, you can use post-it notes spread out on the wall or on your table, or you can use any of the following online tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.mindmup.com/ </li>
  <li>https://draw.io</li>
  <li>https://www.mindmaps.app/</li>
</ul>

<p>The central node of your map should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computing education</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teaching computing</code> or something similar, since everything we’ve talked about has been related to computing education. You will create additional nodes that are offshoots from this central node.</p>

<p><strong>Some minimum requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create <em>at least</em> five child nodes off the central node.</li>
  <li>Each of those child nodes should have <em>at least</em> three child nodes of its own. In other words, besides the central node, your map should have at least 5 direct branches with 3 sub-branches.</li>
  <li>Don’t repeat labels</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, what we have talked about this quarter can easily expand beyond this minimum number of nodes, so you are encouraged to expand the map by adding new nodes at any level as you see fit.</p>

<p>If you’re including a topic that we <em>haven’t</em> talked about, or that you wish we had talked about more, indicate that in the node.</p>

<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h2>

<p>Submit your map as an image. If you worked on pen and paper, take a picture and submit that. If you worked in an online tool, export the map as an image.</p>

<p>Please also add all group members’ names to the Canvas submission.</p>

<p>After you’ve created and submitted your mind-map, be prepared to discuss it with the class.</p>
