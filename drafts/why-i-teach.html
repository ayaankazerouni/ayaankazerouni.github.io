  <h1>Why I Teach</h1>
  <article>
    <div>
      <p> &#9474; <time>507 words</time></p>
      
    </div>
      <p>I recently read a few blog posts that inspired me to write this post.
First, I was inspired by articles from <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">Rachel Thomas</a> and <a href="https://aaronhertzmann.com/2023/09/05/blogging.html">Aaron Hertzmann</a> about how and why to start a blog.
In particular, both of their nudges to not overthink it were emboldening.
Second, and more related to this post, is <a href="https://third-bit.com/2019/01/30/why-i-teach/">Greg Wilson’s post about why he teaches</a>.</p>

<p>I’m often asked why I teach.
I’ve been asked this question in a few different ways and for a few different reasons, depending on who’s asking.
So this post is an attempt to organise and clarify my current thoughts about why I teach.
Like <a href="https://third-bit.com/2019/01/30/why-i-teach/">Greg</a>, my answer will probably change over time, and perhaps I will revisit it from time to time.</p>

<!-- A note before we get started: I'm a tenure-track faculty member at Cal Poly, a primarily undergraduate institution. -->
<!-- This post focuses mostly on the teaching aspect of my job, even though it's one of several hats I wear in my day-to-day. -->

<p>First, with a BS and PhD in computer science, and experience with open-source and professional software development, I probably have more lucrative career paths open to me (provided I’m willing and able to go through the Leetcode circus).
So it’s not an unfair question.</p>

<p>Second—and this one was confusing—a student in my software design class once asked me (I’m paraphrasing, but not much): “So have you worked in industry? It’s just you seem super knowledgeable about this stuff [gestures generally to his surroundings] so I was just wondering why you’re teaching”.
I’ll admit I didn’t really know what to say in the moment, except to ask if he’d like to be taught someone <em>not</em> knowledgeable about [gestures generally to his surroundings].</p>

<p>Third, there are parts of the job I don’t like, and on the worst days they loom largest.
For example, like most people, I intensely dislike dealing with academic dishonesty.
On days like those, it’s worth reminding myself what I like about the job and why I do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It challenges me.</strong> I feel like I am good at this job—I wouldn’t do it otherwise—but I am also regularly met with challenges that help me grow. For example, coming from a background of teaching fundamental programming courses at Virginia Tech and Cal Poly, it was a big change to teach <em>Teaching Computing</em> at Cal Poly for the first time toward the end of my first year. Since then, it’s become pretty much my favourite course that I teach.</li>
  <li><strong>It energises me.</strong> As a pre-tenure faculty member, my day-to-day is dominated by two high-level activities—teaching and research. I find that however well or poorly research is going, I am usually particularly energised after class. This positive energy tends to percolate through the rest of my activities. Of course this depends on how class went that day—it’s not always sunshine and roses. But on most days this is a pretty reliable effect.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s nice to have a positive impact.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Synergy with research + learning from students.</strong></li>
</ul>
